# 📘 Computer Internals for Cybersecurity

This module builds cybersecurity understanding from the hardware level upward.

## Topics Covered

- Binary as hardware control
- Boot process & firmware trust
- CPU execution model (Fetch–Decode–Execute)
- Registers & instruction pointer control
- Stack & memory behavior
- Exploitation foundations (Buffer Overflow, ROP)
- CPU trust assumptions & security implications

---

## Why It Matters

Security professionals cannot defend what they do not understand at execution level.

Modern attacks exploit:
- Memory corruption
- Control flow manipulation
- Privilege boundaries
- Trust assumptions inside the CPU

This module forms the foundation of the CyberWings Security Academy.
